### **2. ABSTRACT (150-200 words)**
```
OBJECTIVE: Critically re-evaluate the efficacy of social media sentiment analysis in cryptocurrency 
price prediction, focusing on the impact of data limitations and model robustness.

METHODS: We developed CryptoPulse, an integrated ML pipeline combining social media data 
(Reddit, Twitter, News) with advanced NLP sentiment analysis. The system collected 15,992 
social media entries, engineered 12 sentiment-based features using FinBERT and Sentence-BERT. 
We trained various ML models, including a new Logistic Regression model with 7 robust features, 
and re-assessed performance using rigorous train/test splits and k-fold cross-validation.

RESULTS: While complex models (e.g., LightGBM) initially showed high accuracy (75%) on a small 
36-sample test set, further analysis revealed this was likely due to overfitting, particularly 
learning from non-semantic features like content length. A simpler Logistic Regression model, 
using a robust 7-feature set, achieved 33.3% accuracy, highlighting the challenges of prediction 
with limited data and providing a more realistic performance baseline.

CONCLUSIONS: Social media sentiment features can be engineered, but their predictive power 
is severely constrained by data sparsity. High reported accuracies on small datasets are 
likely misleading. Future work requires significant data expansion and a focus on model 
robustness over inflated performance metrics.

```

### **7. DISCUSSION**

#### **7.1 Key Insights**
```
BREAKTHROUGH FINDINGS:
1. Data Sparsity is Paramount:
   - The small dataset (178 samples) fundamentally limits the generalizability of findings.
   - High accuracies on complex models are likely artifacts of overfitting, not true predictive power.
   
2. Feature Selection is Critical:
   - Features like `content_length` can lead to spurious correlations and misleading performance metrics.
   - Robust feature sets, even if leading to lower accuracy, provide more reliable insights.
   
3. Model Simplicity for Robustness:
   - Simple, interpretable models (e.g., Logistic Regression) provide a more honest baseline for performance on limited data.
   - Complex models require significantly more data to avoid overfitting and achieve generalizable results.

4. Directional Bias:
   - Models can achieve high overall accuracy by simply predicting the majority class, especially on small, imbalanced datasets.
   - Balanced directional accuracy (Up vs. Down) is a more reliable indicator of true predictive power.
```

#### **7.2 Practical Implications**
```
IMPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ML:
‚Ä¢ Caution against over-reliance on high accuracy metrics from small datasets.
‚Ä¢ Emphasize rigorous statistical validation and transparent reporting of limitations.
‚Ä¢ Prioritize data acquisition and quality over complex model architectures when data is sparse.
‚Ä¢ Focus on building robust, interpretable models that provide actionable insights, even if accuracy is lower.
