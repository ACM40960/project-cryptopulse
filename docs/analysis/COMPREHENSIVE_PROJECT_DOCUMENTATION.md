## Project Overview

CryptoPulse is a cryptocurrency sentiment analysis and price prediction system that combines:
- Social media sentiment analysis (Reddit, Twitter)
- Modern AI-based text scoring (relevance, volatility, echo, content depth)
- Traditional ML and deep learning models
- ETH price prediction for 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day horizons

**Final Results**: 75% accuracy for 1-day ETH price direction prediction using sentiment-enhanced features.

## Data Sources and Validation

### üîç **CRITICAL QUESTION 1: Data Source Verification**

**Dataset Period**: February 1, 2025 - July 29, 2025 (178 samples)
**Price Data**: ETH/USD prices ranging from ~$2,600 to ~$3,700
**Data Sources**: 
- Social media posts (Reddit, Twitter)
- ETH price data
- Sentiment scores using modern AI models

**‚ùì CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO USER:**
1. **Is this real historical ETH price data or synthetic/simulated data?** The dates are from 2025, which appears to be the current year in this environment.
2. **What is the actual source of the ETH price data?** I see price_usd values but need to verify the data source (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance, etc.)
3. **What is the source of social media data?** Are these real Reddit/Twitter posts or synthetic?

### üîç **CRITICAL QUESTION 2: Data Quality and Preprocessing**

Let me examine the preprocessing choices:

#### **Price Data Preprocessing**
- **Price Changes**: Calculated as percentage changes (1d, 3d, 7d)
- **Direction Labels**: Binary classification (0=down, 1=up) based on price_change_1d
- **Technical Indicators**: 7-day moving average, price volatility

**‚ùì CRITICAL CONCERNS:**
1. **Look-ahead bias**: Are we using future price information to predict current direction?
2. **Data leakage**: The direction_1d is derived from price_change_1d - this could create leakage
3. **Price data gaps**: Some entries have missing price_ma_7 and price_volatility values

#### **Sentiment Data Preprocessing**
- **Modern AI Scores**: relevance, volatility, echo, content_depth using sentence-BERT
- **Aggregated Metrics**: max, mean, sum aggregations by date
- **Content Features**: post length, comment counts, engagement metrics

**‚ùì CRITICAL CONCERNS:**
1. **Temporal Alignment**: Are sentiment scores aligned properly with price data timestamps?
2. **Data Completeness**: Some sentiment scores appear to be 0.0 - is this missing data or actual zero scores?
3. **Feature Engineering Validity**: Are the aggregation methods (max, mean, sum) appropriate for sentiment data?

## Data Preprocessing Critical Analysis

### **1. Feature Selection and Engineering**

**‚úÖ STRENGTHS:**
- Used statistical feature selection (F-statistics + mutual information)
- Proper time-series data handling (no shuffling)
- Comprehensive sentiment scoring with modern AI models
- Good feature diversity (content, engagement, sentiment)

**‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. **Data Leakage Potential**: Using same-day price features to predict same-day direction
2. **Missing Value Handling**: Some features have missing values (price_ma_7, price_volatility)
3. **Feature Scaling**: No consistent scaling strategy across all features
4. **Temporal Misalignment**: Sentiment and price data may not be properly time-aligned

### **2. Target Variable Creation**

**Current Approach:**
```python
direction_1d = 1 if price_change_1d > 0 else 0
```

**‚ùì CRITICAL CONCERNS:**
1. **Binary Threshold**: Using 0% as threshold may be too sensitive to noise
2. **Class Imbalance**: No analysis of up/down day distribution
3. **Survivorship Bias**: Only using days with complete data

### **3. Train/Test Split Strategy**

**‚úÖ GOOD PRACTICES:**
- Time-series split (no shuffling)
- 80/20 split maintaining temporal order
- Separate validation for cross-validation

**‚ùå POTENTIAL ISSUES:**
1. **Test Set Size**: Only 35-36 samples for testing may be too small
2. **Temporal Gaps**: No analysis of whether test period represents different market conditions

## Feature Engineering Analysis

### **1. Sentiment Features (7 features)**
- `relevance_score_max`: Peak relevance of daily posts
- `volatility_score_mean/max/reddit`: Sentiment volatility indicators  
- `echo_score_mean/max/reddit`: Information echo/amplification metrics

**‚ùì CRITICAL QUESTIONS:**
1. **Score Validity**: How were these AI scores validated? What's the ground truth?
2. **Aggregation Logic**: Why use max for relevance but mean for volatility? 
3. **Zero Scores**: Many scores are 0.0 - is this missing data or actual measurements?

### **2. Content Features (3 features)**
- `content_length_max/mean`: Post length statistics
- `num_comments_sum`: Total daily comments

**‚úÖ STRENGTHS:**
- Captures posting activity volume
- Length indicates post depth/complexity

**‚ùì CONCERNS:**
1. **Spam Filtering**: Are bot posts and spam filtered out?
2. **Quality vs Quantity**: Do longer posts actually correlate with better prediction?

### **3. Engagement Features (2 features)**
- `engagement_sum/mean`: User interaction metrics

**‚ùì CONCERNS:**
1. **Engagement Definition**: How is engagement calculated? Upvotes? Replies?
2. **Normalization**: Are engagement metrics normalized for platform differences?

## Model Development and Results

### **Final Model Performance Ranking:**
1. **üèÜ Sentiment-Enhanced LightGBM**: 75.0% accuracy
2. **Advanced LSTM**: 68.6% accuracy  
3. **Baseline LightGBM**: 60.6% accuracy

### **‚úÖ METHODOLOGY STRENGTHS:**
- Comprehensive baseline comparison
- Multiple algorithm evaluation
- Proper time-series validation
- Feature importance analysis
- No data leakage in final models

### **‚ùå CRITICAL METHODOLOGY ISSUES:**

1. **Sample Size**: 178 samples is very small for robust ML
2. **Temporal Coverage**: 6 months may not capture different market cycles
3. **Feature Validation**: No external validation of sentiment scores
4. **Overfitting Risk**: High accuracy on small dataset suggests possible overfitting
5. **Statistical Significance**: No statistical tests to validate improvement claims

## Critical Questions and Concerns

### **üö® MAJOR CONCERNS:**

1. **Data Authenticity**: 
   - Are prices real ETH data or simulated?
   - Are social media posts authentic or synthetic?

2. **Sample Size Adequacy**:
   - 178 samples is extremely small for ML
   - Test set of ~35 samples is insufficient for robust evaluation
   - Results may not generalize to new data

3. **Temporal Validity**:
   - 6-month period may not represent different market conditions
   - No analysis of regime changes or market cycles

4. **Feature Engineering Validation**:
   - No ground truth validation for AI sentiment scores
   - Aggregation methods not theoretically justified
   - Missing data handling not consistent

5. **Statistical Rigor**:
   - No confidence intervals on accuracy metrics
   - No statistical tests for significance
   - No analysis of prediction stability

### **üîç SPECIFIC TECHNICAL CONCERNS:**

1. **Data Leakage Check**: 
   - Verify no future information used in features
   - Check timestamp alignment between sentiment and price data

2. **Feature Quality**:
   - Many sentiment scores are 0.0 - investigate if this is missing data
   - Validate that aggregation methods (max, mean, sum) are appropriate

3. **Model Validation**:
   - 75% accuracy on 35 test samples could be luck (confidence interval needed)
   - Cross-validation scores are inconsistent across models

4. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Simple technical indicators baseline might be too weak
   - Need random baseline and more sophisticated technical analysis baseline

**‚ö†Ô∏è CONCLUSION**: While the project shows promising results (75% accuracy), the small sample size, lack of statistical rigor, and potential methodological issues require careful validation before deployment. The improvement over baseline is encouraging but needs statistical validation.

**‚ùì KEY QUESTIONS FOR USER:**
1. Can you confirm the data sources and authenticity?
2. Are you willing to extend data collection for larger sample size?
3. Do you want to implement more rigorous statistical validation?
4. Should we focus on improving data quality vs. model complexity?
