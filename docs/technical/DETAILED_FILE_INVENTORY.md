# CryptoPulse: Detailed File Inventory and Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of every component in the CryptoPulse project, with critical assessment of data sources, preprocessing choices, and methodology.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FINDINGS:**
- Dataset has only 178 samples (extremely small for ML)
- Test set has only ~35 samples (insufficient for robust evaluation)
- Many sentiment scores are 0.0 (potential missing data issue)
- No statistical significance testing of results
- Potential data leakage concerns

## 1. Core Data Files Analysis

### 1.1 Primary Dataset: `data/simplified_ml_dataset.csv`
**Purpose**: Final ML-ready dataset with 178 samples
**Time Range**: February 1, 2025 - July 29, 2025 (178 days)
**Features**: 12 selected features + price data + targets

**Structure Analysis:**
```
Columns (22 total):
- date: Primary timestamp
- 12 sentiment/content features (selected via statistical methods)
- price_usd: ETH price in USD
- price_change_1d/3d/7d: Price change percentages  
- direction_1d/3d/7d: Binary direction labels (targets)
- price_ma_7: 7-day moving average
- price_volatility: Price volatility measure
```

**üö® CRITICAL ISSUES:**
