Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) Model Placeholder for CryptoPulse

This script serves as a placeholder for the implementation of a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model.
The TFT is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for time-series forecasting that combines:
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for processing time-varying data.
- Self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies.
- Static and dynamic feature processing.

Full implementation is a significant undertaking and is marked as future work.
